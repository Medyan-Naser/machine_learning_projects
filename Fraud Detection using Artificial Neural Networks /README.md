## Deep Learning

The ANN (Artificial Neural Network) implementation in this project demonstrates how a deep learning model can be used to classify data efficiently. It consists of multiple layers, including an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer, optimized to predict categorical outcomes.

This section provides an overview of the ANN's architecture, training process, and performance evaluation. The results are presented through Accuracy vs. Epochs and Loss vs. Epochs graphs, which help visualize the model's training progress and predictive performance.
