# AI in Networking

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are transforming how modern networks are managed, optimized, and secured. As networks grow in complexity with 5G, cloud computing, and IoT, traditional manual or rule-based management becomes insufficient. AI-driven approaches enable **automation**, **predictive analytics**, and **self-optimization** across the entire network stack.

## üåê Key Applications of AI in Networking

### 1. **Traffic Analysis and Prediction**
AI models can learn network behavior patterns to:

- Predict congestion before it occurs.
- Optimize bandwidth allocation dynamically.
- Classify and prioritize network traffic (e.g., voice vs. data).

Machine learning algorithms such as **LSTM**, **CNN**, and **Random Forests** are commonly used for time-series traffic prediction.

### 2. **Anomaly Detection and Network Security**
AI helps identify unusual network activity that may indicate intrusions or misconfigurations:
- Detect zero-day attacks using pattern recognition.
- Automate incident response.
- Enhance intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewalls with real-time learning.

Techniques: **Autoencoders**, **Clustering**, **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**.

### 3. **Self-Optimizing Networks (SON)**
In cellular and 5G networks, AI enables **self-configuration**, **self-healing**, and **self-optimization** by analyzing network KPIs in real-time.

Examples:
- Automated cell coverage adjustments.
- Power and frequency optimization.
- Dynamic load balancing across base stations.
