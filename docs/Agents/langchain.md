# LangChain

## Introduction
LangChain is an **open-source framework** for building AI applications with Large Language Models (LLMs).  
It provides a modular environment to connect **LLMs, retrieval systems (RAG), and tools** into production-ready workflows.

It provides modular components to design workflows where an LLM can **reason, retrieve, and act**.

## Why LangChain?
- LLMs alone generate text but lack grounding.  
- Retrieval (RAG) improves factual accuracy.  
- **LangChain orchestrates reasoning + retrieval + tools** into dynamic pipelines.  

**Benefits**:  
- Simplifies integration of models like GPT-4.  
- Enables workflow automation and content management.  
- Unlocks flexible NLP applications (chatbots, summarization, Q&A, analytics).

## Core Components
1. **Chains** – Sequences of LLM calls, retrievers, and tools.  
2. **Agents** – LLM-powered decision makers that choose actions.  
3. **Memory** – Stores past interactions for context continuity.  
4. **Tools** – External capabilities (APIs, DB queries, search engines).  
5. **LangChain Core** – Expression language and abstractions.  
6. **LangChain Community** – Third-party integrations (OpenAI, IBM, Anthropic).

## Prompt Engineering & In-Context Learning
LangChain also supports **prompt engineering**, guiding LLMs to perform specific tasks without retraining.

- **In-Context Learning** – Provide task examples directly in the prompt; no fine-tuning required.  
- **Zero-Shot Prompting** – Model performs tasks with only instructions (e.g., classify a statement as true/false).  
- **One-Shot Prompting** – One example provided to guide the task.  
- **Few-Shot Prompting** – Several examples used to help the model generalize.  
- **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** – Prompts the model to explain reasoning step by step.  
- **Self-Consistency** – Multiple outputs are generated, and the most consistent answer is selected.  

LangChain offers **prompt templates** to standardize and reuse these approaches.

## Example Workflow
1. User asks: *"Summarize the company’s mobile policy."*  
2. Pipeline:  
      - Encode query → Search FAISS index → Retrieve top chunks  
      - Add retrieved context to prompt → Send to LLM  
      - Generate precise summary

## Use Case: Content Management
A company managing blogs, videos, podcasts, and articles can use LangChain to:  
- Automate retrieval and summarization.  
- Tag and classify large content libraries.  
- Build agents for recommendations and distribution.  

---

## Key Takeaways
- LangChain = **LLM + Retrieval + Tools + Memory + Prompt Engineering**.  
- Supports advanced prompting: **zero-shot, few-shot, CoT, self-consistency**.  
- Best for building **flexible AI workflows** in domains like content management, chatbots, analytics, and text processing.
