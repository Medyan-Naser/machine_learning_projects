# machine_learning_projects

Welcome to the Machine Learning Projects repository! This collection contains diverse machine learning projects showcasing practical implementations of key concepts in classification, regression, clustering, deep learning, and natural language processing. Each project is accompanied by visualizations to help interpret the results and performance of the models.

## Classification
In this project, we applied seven distinct classification algorithms to the same dataset to evaluate their performance. Our analysis revealed that the Random Forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy on the test set.

### Classification Algorithms Used

Each algorithm was trained and tested on the same dataset. The performance was assessed using accuracy scores and visualized through confusion matrices. Below are the placeholders for the confusion matrices of each classifier:

## Regression
In this section, we explore the performance of five regression models. While Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression were applied to unique datasets tailored to their modeling assumptions, the remaining models—Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression—were tested on the same dataset, enabling direct comparison.

## Deep Learning

The ANN (Artificial Neural Network) implementation in this project demonstrates how a deep learning model can be used to classify data efficiently. It consists of multiple layers, including an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer, optimized to predict categorical outcomes.

This section provides an overview of the ANN's architecture, training process, and performance evaluation. The results are presented through Accuracy vs. Epochs and Loss vs. Epochs graphs, which help visualize the model's training progress and predictive performance.

## Clustering

This section demonstrates clustering techniques to group data points based on their inherent similarities, using K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering.

1. K-Means Clustering
Partition the dataset into k clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

2. Hierarchical Clustering
Build a hierarchy of clusters either through agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down) approaches.
